				<h1>My First and Best Video game So Far: 'Space Intakers'</h1>
				<p>'Space Intakers’ would be what I consider my first official game.
					Indeed I have worked on other games and built the concept for some
					games in my lifetime, but none have been close to as impressive as
					'Space Intakers'. It was originally an assignment for one of my many
					first-year CS courses, but I decided it was too late to leave in
					the past, and I prefer to carry it with me as a symbol of how far
					I’ve come and learned in my journey to being a game designer and
					creator</p>

			<div class="explanation">
				<p> The song, which I found by scouring YouTube, was the perfect
					soundtrack for the game. It was created by a Youtuber called Waterflame,
					and I knew it would be what I needed for the game. The game was inspired by the
					classic 'Space Invaders' arcade game, but mixed with a bit of my
					personal style. I wanted something louder, more colourful and
					-paced than the original game, and hence 'Space Intakers' was born.
					I plan for this to be the first iteration of the game, as many
					more would likely come, perhaps with more story and plot
					to the space-themed arcade game.
