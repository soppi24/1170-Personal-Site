			<h1>A cute and Comfy Platformer: "Benny's world"</h1>
			<div id="contentBox">
				<p>This was something on the light, cuter side. The main character’s name is Ben,
					and this musically based game is meant to be a platform game
					like Mario, where the character runs through this imaginary magic
					world getting several prizes like candy and toys. His goal
					is to get 5 special missing instruments to bring music back to
					the magical land.</p>

			<h1>Exploring and Building: 'Charlotte's World'</h1>
			<div id="contentBox">
				<div id="charBoxText">
					<p>This game was an extension of Ben’s game, perhaps his sister having
						her own spin-off game. Except hers is not a platformer, but rather a
						3d game with movement all around where in her imagination, she's a mayor.
						The game is heavily based on Animal Crossing, one of my favourite game
						series. As mayor, she (and the player) has several tasks to do such as</p>
					<ol>
						<li>Build public projects</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Schools</li>
							<li>Hospitals</li>
						</ul>
						<li>Interact and play with citizens</li>
						<li>Travel to different parts of the world</li>
						<li>And much more</li>
					</ol>

			<h1>Time Travel and Adventure: 'The Quinn Paradox' </h1>
			<div id="contentBox">
				<p>This is a more mature game idea; not as cute and fluffy as the other
					few game ideas. The concept is based on a teenage guy who’s a physics
					and engineering student, who managed to accidently get a time machine
					to work, but unfortunately, he’s caused a major problem, like a rift
					between realities. It’s up to him (the player) and the alternate
					versions of himself to clean up his mess and stop the realities
					from colliding.</p>

			<h1>History with a Twist: 'Historia'</h1>
			<div id="contentBox">
				<p>Historia is, well as the name suggests, a history-based game.
					I’m an avid history buff, and having a game based on some of my
					favourite time periods is something I’ve thought of doing. The
					game is an educational-adventure type of game, where you learn
					about certain events through the eyes of a minor character, get
					to meet some of the histories' greatest (and not-so-great) people,
					and learn the impact their actions had on our lives today. The picture
					beside is some concept art for Napoleon and Charles de Gaulle, just
					to plan out what the basic character would look like but I plan to add
					more characters and designs to the set.</p>

			<h1>Silliness and Fun: 'Bobble Wrap Gang' </h1>
			<div id="bobbleBoxText">
				<img src="../Pictures/bobble.png" alt="Bobble girls picture" width=auto height=auto>
				<p>This is less of a game, and more of an interactive comic. It’s based
					on 4 characters I created, each with dumb but lovable personalities,
					that mostly goof around but share valuable life lessons. I haven’t
					spent a lot of time developing this one, but I was thinking perhaps
					the player can create a character to join them and they’d go on dumb,
					silly and lighthearted adventures together. Let’s introduce each character:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Bella Bunny - Level-headed leader who makes sure everyone hasn’t
						gone mad (yet)</li>
					<li>Fiona Frog - Has a Napoleon Complex and is very sassy, but
						she means well (most times)</li>
					<li>Delilah Dog - Might not be the brightest, but
						has the biggest heart</li>
					<li>Cecelia Cat - The smart one who would rather be buried in her books
						than anywhere else. Unfortunately, she’s stuck with these 3</li>
				</ol>
